# Irrigation-design-website
website for personal use and testing of ruby, html, css concepts


My goal with this is to make a basic website for irrigation design buisness. 
I want to implement taking in forms and send them to a forign server that I will host.
I also want to make an asteticly pleasing website with css and html I have learned and add features that I 
havent been able to use yet. These goals will grow and change but just get used to working in a 'normal' developer workspace
albet self servicing and ajusting.
